## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to housing policy in New York City and the work of the rent guidelines board especially as it relates to a dearth of data on tenants.  
Other things that could be interesting:
- Taiwan/China tensions and datasets of online reactions
- Something with rowing?
